# Extrative Column Simulation

This is part of my chemical engineering conclusion work.
In this repository you will find three important files:

1. "MethanolDistillation.py"
  This file apllies the "BinaryDistillation" class from BioSTEAM library to simulate a methanol extractive distillation column with the controlled variables.

2. "values.py"
  In this file are the functions to write in a .csv file the data simulated for random entry values in the determined range.

3. "ins_data.csv"
  This is the .csv file produced by the simulation to be used after.

After the simulation this data can be used to train machine learning algorithms to model mathematically the extractive distillation column.


The generated model can be used to find the optimized column design or for decision making in an existing industrial plant.
